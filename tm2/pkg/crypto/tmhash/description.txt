# Hash Pool Implementation for Memory Optimization

This PR improves performance by implementing a sync.Pool for hash objects in tmhash package. Hash calculations, especially in the mempool, create many short-lived objects that increase GC pressure. By reusing hash objects, we reduce memory allocations while maintaining the same functionality.

The implementation preserves the existing API entirely, ensuring all current code continues to work without modification. Tests confirm identical behavior with better performance characteristics under load.
